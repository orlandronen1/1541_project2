Config file:
1. size of L1 instruction cache in KB
2. associativity of L1 instruction cache
3. size of L1 data cache in KB
4. associativity of L1 data cache
5. size of L2 cache in KB (0 means no L2 cache)
6. associativity of L2 cache
7. cache block size in bytes (same for all)
8. L2 access time in cycles
9. memory access time in cycles

Cache assumptions:
1. all blocks in caches are initially invalid
2. "write allocate" policy applied on a write miss
3. "write back" policy applies
4. LRU block replacement (using an LRU stack for each cache set)
5. L2 is inclucsive in that a block isn't evicted from L2 if it is in L1
6. access time for L1 cache is 0 cycles (access completed within execution cycle)

After going through a trace file, print the following statistics (in this format):
L1 Data cache:          [] accesses, [] hits, [] misses, [] miss rate
L1 Instruction cache:   [] accesses, [] hits, [] misses, [] miss rate
L2 cache:               [] accesses, [] hits, [] misses, [] miss rate

TODO:
1. Read from config file
2. Include functions from project 1 in cache.h
3. Update loop as found in project 1 (do first)
4. Update loop to include the data cache in addition to instruction cache
5. Create an L2 cache variable (and include in cache_access function?)
